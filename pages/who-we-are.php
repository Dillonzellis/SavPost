                        <p>Savannah Postal Credit Union is a State-chartered credit union   incorporated June 6, 1952. For more than 53 years we have existed solely   for the purpose of serving our members' best interests. The credit   union was originally established for employees of the United States   Postal Service. Today we serve 10 employee groups in Savannah and the   surrounding counties. We enable these employers and associations to   offer their employees and associates all the benefits of credit union   membership at no cost to their companies or associations. Credit Union   membership is also available to immediate family members regardless of   where they live or work. </p>
                        <p>Our "Mission Statement" is as follows: </p>
                        <p><em>Our Purpose is to provide quality products and services to our members that are mutually profitable to both the member and to the credit union, while insuring that sound financial policies are practiced. </em></p>
                        <p>The Board of Directors administers the credit   union. These Directors are members of the credit union elected by the   membership. Those who serve on the Board as well as the Committee   Members are unpaid volunteers. The Board establishes the policies by   which the credit union operates, and is responsible for making decisions   with the members' and the credit unions' as a whole best interest in   mind. </p>
                        <p>Savannah Postal Credit Union offers the utmost in   security to our members and accounts are insured for up to $250,000.00   by NCUA, a U.S. Government agency. </p>
                        <p>We currently have more than 2600 members with assets   of $19 million plus. As we continue to grow we strive to offer our   members the best service and products possible with a concentrated   effort on personal service. It is our hope that we will be able to offer   credit union membership to more groups in the future. </p>
