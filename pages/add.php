                  you are eligible for $2,000 Accidental Death &amp; Dismemberment 
                  Insurance. Premiums for this basic coverage will be paid by 
                  your credit union. Coverage is provided to all members at no 
                  cost. In order to put your coverage in force, you must complete 
                  a form provided by the credit union which can obtained at the 
                  credit union office or by calling 1-800-252-2148 and ask for 
                  the Insurance Desk. At the age of 70 coverage is reduced to 
                  $1,000. </p>
                        <p>There is a new enrollment opportunity if members want additional 
                          benefits for an extra charge, and premiums are deducted from 
                          their share accounts quarterly.</p>
                        <p>This summary explains in general terms the insurance described, 
                          but in no way changes or affects the insurance afforded under 
                          such Policy as actually issued. All coverages are subject 
                          to actual Policy conditions and exclusions. Each member participating 
                          in the plan will receive a Certificate of Insurance describing 
                          the exact coverage and benefits provided. The insurance is 
                          provided under Policy Series 6363.</p>
